Practical tests to be performed to ensure no regression prior to each release :

Code :
	grep -rn "~0x[0-9][0-9];" src # This should be done after make and before clean to ensure that no macros etc expand into notted 8 bit literals.
	grep -rn "&= \!" src          # This may need some refinement to actually work.
	White space is correct and variable naming is correct, need to automate this.

RTOutputs:
	Sweep RPM 0 - max - 0 and sweep iat, map, cht, and other key inputs for each successive sweep, watch scope and saleae for weirdness

Comms tests:
	Drop each type of packet through and ensure the correct response. There should be a packet type for each and every code path created.

Unit tests:
	Execute all unit tests and ensure that no regressions have occurred.

Decoders:
	bench and/or on-vehicle testing of all decoder variants - no regressions, new decoders work
